# MieHolo

MieHolo offers some matlab functions to generate and fit holograms
that produced by a single sphere under plane incident light.

## System Requirements

* Matlab R2013b or newer, earlier versions should also work but not tested.
* Optimization Toolbox.
* Image Processing Toolbox. 

Image Pocessing Toolbox dependency may be removed by replacing `fspecial`
function in `radialcenter.m` with a predefined image filter. And replace
`imshow` function in example `gen_holo.m` with `image` function.


## Usage
First add `fit/` and `mie/` folder to your matlab path.

Typically there are 3 functions to be used:

* mie_holo
* fit1d
* fit2d

Example codes can be found  in `example/` folder.

### Generate holograms

`mie_holo` is used to generate holograms.
You should first generate a meshgrid to define a image plane. 
See the example below.
v and h are vertical and horizonal coordinates relative to the 
origin of the image plane.

To generate a 201*201 hologram with pixel size 0.2um, and a silica sphere
(n=1.456, radius=1) located at 30um above the focal plane in water:

```matlab
np = 1.456;
ns = 1.33;
wavelen = 0.66;
radius = 1;
pixsize = 0.2;
v_range = linspace(0, 200*pixsize, 201); %grid origin is in upper left conner
h_range = linspace(0, 200*pixsize, 201); %point values are in actual unit
v = 20;
h = 20;
z = 30;
[h_grid, v_grid] = meshgrid(h_range, v_range);
holo = mie_holo(np,ns,wavelen,radius,v_grid,h_grid,v,h,z);
imshow(holo,[]);
```
You can pass additional parameters to `mie_holo` to change incident light
properties, see `mie/mie_holo.m` for more details.

### Fit holograms

'fit1d' and 'fit2d' are used to fit experimental holograms to mie solutions
to extract characteristics of a sphere.

To use these functions, you need to run the configuration code to set parameters.
Copy `config_sample.m` and edit parameters in the copied file,
then pass hologram and parameters to the function.

See `example/fit_holo.m`
